<p>GSoC is here</p>

<p>In around mid January, Programming Club organised a workshop on the following topics-</p>
<ul>
<li>Open-Source </li>
<li>Version Control </li>
<li>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) </li>
<li>Mailing list </li>
</ul>

<p>When I got notified about the workshop, I was reluctant to attend it. I had been delving deep into front end development during that time. And being a noob programmer, I thought maybe it was a bit too much for me to focus on multiple domains of programming.</p> <p> But that innate curiosity within me was craving to find out what exactly those alien terminologies meant. After much introspection, I finally decided to attend the workshop. Even though I promised myself not to get distracted into these things. Little did I know how terribly wrong I was. And how my life would change completely!! (in a positive sense)</p>

<p>At the workshop, our two coordinators, Saksham and Pallav, introduced us to this overwhelming world of Open-Source development. They explained that the four terms mentioned above are all a significant part of Open source. IRC is a primitive looking messaging client which is heavily used by developer community these days.</p> <p> Most of us were already familiar with Github so it wasn't much difficult to understand how Version control worked. We also got to know some ways in which we can contribute to those projects. Mostly by looking for issues with the following tags <code>newbie</code>, <code>easy</code>, <code>package-novice</code> etc.</p>

<p>What the coordies actually wanted was to introduce us to a worldwide annual open-source competition held in summers. Popularly known as <b>Google Summer of Code</b>. As it is obvious in the name itself, GSoC was organised by Google. Though the interesting part, we're not supposed to work for Google if selected, rather any organisation/project we find interesting. </p>
