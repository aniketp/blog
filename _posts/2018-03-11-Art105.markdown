The ancient wisdom

Mark stumbled down the creeks, he desperately needed a shelter. He had been roaming in the woods for far too long to be safe. People from the nearby village had warned him about nasty creatures who lived in the woods and made appalling noises in the night. Although he was on high-alert for the whole time, he was too skeptical to believe mischevious noisy creatures lurking around in the woods. "Wolfs, probably", he mused.  

The clouds thundered. "Looks like its going to rain soon, I should find some safe place to retire for tonight". There were rotten trees all around, with the irksome sound of vampires hustling though the space above him. He gazed over the horizon. Through the distant moonlight, there seemed to be a distinct silhouette of what looked like a collosal cottage. Without giving a second thought, he rushed quickly towards it. As he got closer, the shape of the cottage started becoming more prominent. It looked more like an abandoned tower.

"What is this strange tower doing in the middle of nowhere, doesn't look inhabited at all", he thought out loud. His back of the ear was tingling, something about this tower didn't look right. As he stepped closer, there was a flash of light from inside the front aperture. He stiffened. Something was moving inside the tower. His hands reached inside his pocket, searching for his knife in case the situation got out of hand. On reaching the front entrance, he inspected the doors. They seemed to have been opened recently and someone forgot to close the doors. Now, completely sure that something was going on inside, he entered the tower.

The tower was gloomy with lots of old paintings lying around. There was a prominent staircase in the distance. Spider webs hung from the ceiling as if they've flourished for a long time. At first thought, it occurred to him that probably it is a hideout of some village robbers or rogue bandits. But first he had to make sure that the tower was safe. As he didn't want to be harmed or killed in the sleep. He thought of exploring the distant part of the tower. Moving in, he heard a distant ruffle coming from in front of him. Followed by a deep rumble from beneath. At first he thought he might have heard the winds, but then the rumblings got louder, as if the sound was being reverbrated from a large area. Confused as to what this might mean, he followed the source of the sound. It seemed to be coming from the staircase. He moved quickly towards the stairs only to find that there wasn't any opening for the stairs. Although, it seemed that the stairs gave way to a hollow underground. Intrigued, he started inspecting the floor. It looked like there was an empty space beneath it. "But how come the stair doesn't have an opening? There must be some kind of basement inside. But it's closed."

Unable to find any reason, he started searching around for some clue as to what this weird design meant. He was sure there must be a secret opening hidden from plain sight. He reached out for his little flashlight he had been carrying with him. On a quick glimpse, nothing seemed unusual. The wall was mostly concrete, with rough surface openings protruding from the higher walls.

Dejected, he started going back.

"Creeeeeeekk"

Mark turned around quickly. He was sure something moved behind him.    

With a quick sweep of the torch, he noticed something unusual. There was a strang engraving on the wall. It looked like a triangle inside which was an eye and waves radiating off it.

He had seen it before, it looked suspicious. "But why didn't I see this when I first got here? It just couldn't have appeared out of nowhere..". With no other option left, he thought maybe he should try to see what exactly it meant. Just as he placed his fingertips on the engravings. The rumbling started again. But this time the ground beneath was shaking too.

Alarmed, he desperately looked for en exit. But just then, an opening at the foot of the staircase appeared. It looked like the floor moved slightly to let him see what was below the floor. As he stepped closer, he could hear those deep rumbling sounds again. Only they seemed more prominent this time. Inching closer, he could feel his heartbeat quicken. There was something very dangerous below the floor.

Little did he know someone was following him from behind.

As Mark stepped closer to the opening, he suddenly felt a push to his back. He stumbled forwards and fell through the ground. It was his luck that he landed on a soft ground. Quickly adjusting to the dimmer light, he realised he was being stared at. He looked around, people started to appear, dressed in the masks of what looked like a demon. It had only one eye.

He could see they all had large daggers in their hands. It looked like they were circling in on him, as if he was their next target. He couldn't process all that was happening around him.

After forming a close circle, they all stopped. What followed next was a dead silence for a minute. Mark could feel himself sweating, for he didn't know what to do. Suddenly, a man started walking forward, slowly. Mark could feel his eyes burning on him, as if he would eat him alive.

The man stopped very close to him. He could feel his rotten breath on his skin. Carefully, the man drew his dagger and placed it beneath Mark's chins.
His face revealing a crooked smile, and his lips moved,

"Welcome to Illuminati, what is your last wish?"
